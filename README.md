   smc.version = "0"
   cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
   cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
   cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
   cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
   cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
   cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
